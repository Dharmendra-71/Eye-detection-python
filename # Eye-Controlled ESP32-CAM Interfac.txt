# Eye-Controlled ESP32-CAM Interface

This project implements a simple real-time eye tracking system using OpenCV and Python to control an ESP32-CAM module over Wi-Fi. By analyzing vertical eye movement, it sends directional commands (UP, DOWN, STOP) to the ESP32-CAM for controlling robots or other IoT devices.

## 🔧 Features

- Detects eye position using Haar Cascades
- Compares eye position to a target Y-coordinate
- Sends commands (`up`, `down`, or `stop`) to an ESP32 via HTTP
- Real-time webcam feed with visual eye tracking
- Adjustable sensitivity and IP configuration
